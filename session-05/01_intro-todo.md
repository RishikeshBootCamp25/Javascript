# To-Do List App â€“ Introduction

In this session, we will build a **To-Do List App**.

---

## What is a To-Do List App?
It is a simple app where you can:
- Add new tasks (e.g., "Do homework")
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks when done

---

## Why build this?
This project helps you practice:
- **DOM manipulation** (creating and removing elements)
- **Event listeners** (responding to clicks)
- **Arrays/variables** (storing tasks)
- **Functions** (to organize code)

---

At the end, you will have your **first productivity app** built with JavaScript!

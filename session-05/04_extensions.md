# Extensions for the To-Do List App

Once your app is working, try adding these **extra features**:

---

## 1. Save Tasks (Local Storage)
So that tasks don’t disappear when you refresh the page.

Hint: Use  
```js
localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(tasks));
````

---

## 2. Clear All Tasks

Add a button that removes all tasks from the list.

---

## 3. Count Remaining Tasks

Show how many tasks are left to complete.

---

## 4. Improve Styles with CSS

* Different colors for completed tasks
* Bigger buttons
* Nice fonts

---

## 5. Challenge 

* Add a “Due Date” for tasks
* Add categories like **Homework**, **Chores**, **Fun**

---

These extras are optional but will make your To-Do App more **professional and fun**!

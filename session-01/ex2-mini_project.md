# Mini Project: Greeting Program

We will build a **simple program** that asks the user for their name and greets them.


## Steps
1. Ask the user for their name (using `prompt`).
2. Store it in a variable.
3. Print a greeting message in the console.


<!-- ## Code
let userName = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log("Hello " + userName + "! Welcome to JavaScript Bootcamp"); -->

# Worksheet: Functions in JavaScript

Practice writing your own functions.  
Each problem will help you understand how functions make coding easier.

---

## 1. Hello Function
Write a function called `sayHello` that prints `"Hello, welcome to coding!"` when called.  
Call it **3 times**.

---

## 2. Greeting with Name
Write a function called `greet(name)` that takes a name as a parameter and prints  
`"Hello [name], nice to meet you!"`.

👉 Example:  
```js
greet("Sam"); // Output: Hello Sam, nice to meet you!
````

---

## 3. Add Two Numbers

Write a function called `addNumbers(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.

👉 Example:

```js
console.log(addNumbers(5, 7)); // Output: 12
```

---

## 4. Area of Rectangle

Write a function called `areaOfRectangle(length, width)` that returns the area.

👉 Formula: `area = length * width`

---

## 5. Even or Odd

Write a function called `isEven(number)` that returns:

* `true` if the number is even
* `false` if the number is odd

---

## 6. Find Maximum of Two Numbers

Write a function called `findMax(a, b)` that returns the bigger number.

👉 Example:

```js
console.log(findMax(10, 25)); // Output: 25
```

---

## 7. Simple Calculator

Write a function called `calculate(num1, num2, operator)` that:

* Adds if operator is `"+"`
* Subtracts if operator is `"-"`
* Multiplies if operator is `"*"`
* Divides if operator is `"/"`

---

## 8. Multiplication Table

Write a function called `printTable(number)` that prints the multiplication table of that number (from 1 to 10).

---

## 9. Factorial

Write a function called `factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of `n`.
👉 Example: `factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

---

## 10. Palindrome Checker (Challenge ⭐)

Write a function called `isPalindrome(word)` that returns:

* `true` if the word is the same forwards and backwards
* `false` otherwise

👉 Example:

```js
isPalindrome("level"); // true
isPalindrome("hello"); // false
```

---

# 📌 Tips

* Use `return` when you want the function to give back a value.
* Use `console.log()` to check your answers.
* Try different inputs for each function!
